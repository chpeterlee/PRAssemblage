>> How can [Player_U$_2019] military's Quantum Computer
help optimize its immediate conversion
into an environmental regenerative corps
in order to:

1. Employ the impoverished soldiers it generated
by using 54% of [Player_U$] country's budget
to impoverish other populations - 

2.  Address its track record that includes
• artificially creating gender inequalities
through a large standing institution
that sharply divided labor
• enforce artificial constructions of race (in [World_West])
• create the artificial subjectivity known as 'worker'
• displace and dispossess hundreds of millions
(both [World_West] and [World_Non_West)

3. Immediately convert its mission to prevent
• these same oppressed humans from fighting
other oppressed humans in conflicts that:
    • are a direct result from the [Game_Global] climate change that
    the [Player_U$_2019] military is the #1 driver of, up to 70%

4. And how do we mediate this through:
• mini-games
• fan-fiction
• fictional poetic riddles

that imaginatively stay within the bounds of the game
and make creative use of the game's 'softer players'
(such as the game's academics, artists and wives)?"
